# Monitor web performance over time.

[WebPageTest](https://webpagetest.org) is an incredibly useful resource for any web developer, but the power of the information it provides is much more valuable when monitored constantly, rather than at individual times. SpeedTracker runs on top of it by making period performance tests on your website and showing the evolution of the various metrics over time.

This allows you to constantly evaluate how new features or infrastructural changes impact the perceived performance of your website.your website.

Companies like [Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/) or [SpeedCurve](https://speedcurve.com/) offer this as a professional (and far more comprehensive) service, but not everyone can afford them. Whether you're part of a small company or run a non-profit/open-source project, SpeedTracker can help you keep an eye on the performance of your website for free.
