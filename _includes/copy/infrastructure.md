# Runs on your GitHub repository.

Data from WebPageTest is pushed to a GitHub repository, owned by you, where a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site will work as the visualisation layer. It can be served from GitHub Pages, from a private or public repository, with HTTPS baked in for free. You can even use your custom domain.

# Deploy your own API. (If you want to.)

The API layer, a small Node.js application that handles the communication with WebPageTest and GitHub, is available as an open-source project you can run on your own infrastructure. Alternatively, you can simply use the public instance that is available for anyone to use for free.
