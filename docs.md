<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

SpeedTracker consists of two separate components: an API layer and a visualisation layer. The former is a Node.js application that processes test requests and handles all communication between you, WebPageTest and GitHub. The latter is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) running a small React application.

Both these pieces are available as open-source projects, which you can run on your own infrastructure. However, this guide will document the use case of using our hosted API layer, publicly available for anyone to use for free, and hosting the visualisation component on a GitHub repository, served via GitHub Pages.

If you wish to run the API yourself, please refer to the documentation on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/speedtracker/speedtracker-api).

<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>

SpeedTracker is built on top of WebPageTest. If you don't have access to a private WebPageTest instance, you can use the public one, for which you will need to [request an API key](https://www.webpagetest.org/getkey.php). SpeedTracker will use this key to request tests on your behalf.

Each key comes with a limit of 200 page loads per day, as explained on the link above. You will be subject to the WebPageTest terms of service.

<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>

The first step is to set up a copy of the visualisation layer. To do this, fork the [SpeedTracker repository](https://github.com/speedtracker/speedtracker-frontend) into your own GitHub account or organisation.

SpeedTracker must have push access to your newly-created GitHub repository. To avoid asking you for a Personal Access Token, which would grant us push access to all your repositories, you can simply give push access to our [friendly bot](https://github.com/speedtracker-bot) on just the repository you created.

To do this, go to the **Settings** pane on your repository, navigate to **Collaborators** and add the user **speedtracker-bot**. At this point, the invitation you just sent is still pending, so you need to prod the bot for it to accept your request. 

Use the [connect tool](/connect) for this. Alternatively, open the following link in your browser, replacing the placeholders with your GitHub username or organisation, the name of the repository and the name of the branch you installed the Jekyll site on (typically *master* or *gh-pages*):

```
https://api.speedtracker.org/v1/connect/{USERNAME}/{REPOSITORY}
```

Finally, you need to enable GitHub Pages for your repository. Go to **Settings** and scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section. From there, select which branch you want to serve your site from. From this section, you can also set up a custom domain.

<h1 id="configuration">Configuration</h1>

SpeedTracker will read from a number of files in your repository, namely `speedtracker.yml`, the main config file. Since this file will be available for anyone to see (unless your repository is private), we need to protect some of the sensitive information it contains, such as your WebPageTest API key or e-mail address.

To do this, you need to create a key/password that you will use to encrypt any sensitive information. When you make a request to the SpeedTracker API, you'll need to provide this password as URL parameter. The API will use this to decrypt information as well as to identify you.

The [SpeedTracker encryption tool](/encrypt) is a small utility to encrypt any given text with a key of your choice. After you come up with a safe password for your site, you can use this tool to encrypt anything with it.

The first thing to encrypt is the key itself, for the `encryptionKey` parameter in the config. So if your key is `foobar123`, use that in both the *Text* and *Key* fields and you'll get `0a5f0c0670219dc049`. If you want to then encrypt your email address, use *joe.bloggs@email.com* as the *Text* and `foobar123` as the key and so on.

The table below shows what each configuration parameter is for, and whether or not its contents must be encrypted.

| Parameter | Description | Encrypted |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `encryptionKey` | Key to be used for encrypting parameters | Yes |
| `wptKey` | WebPageTest API key | Yes |
| `alerts` | Channels for performance budget alerts to be delivered on (see [alerts](#alerts)) | Partially |

<h2 id="profiles">Profiles</h2>

Every test runs against a profile, which consists of a pre-defined group of parameters, such as the website URL and other parameters used by WebPageTest, such as connectivity type, location or number of runs.

You can use different profiles to monitor different sites, or simply different variations of the same test (e.g. one profile for a Cable connection, another one for 3G). You need to define at least one profile, so start by editing the existing `_profiles/default.html`.

The following parameters can be used to configure a profile:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `default` | Whether the profile is the default one, loaded on the root path | `true` |
| `interval` | Defines an interval (in hours) for the test to be executed (see [scheduling tests](#scheduling-tests)) | `12` |
| `name` | Name of the profile | `eduardoboucas.com (3G)` |
| `budgets` | Performance budgets | See [budgets](#budgets) |
| `parameters` | WebPageTest test parameters. `url` is mandatory | See below |

The `parameters` key will accept any parameter used by the [WebPageTest API](https://github.com/marcelduran/webpagetest-api). The following block shows how to configure a profile to test https://eduardoboucas.com on a 3G connection, from Dulles, with 1 run and video capture. Only `url` is mandatory.

Since we're setting `default: true`, this will be the main test and will be the one shown when we access our root URL.

```markdown
---
default: true
name: 'eduardoboucas.com (3G)'
parameters:
  connectivity: '3G'
  location: 'Dulles:Chrome'
  firstViewOnly: true
  runs: 1
  url: "https://eduardoboucas.com"
  video: true
---
```

<h2 id="scheduling-tests">Scheduling tests</h2>

Recurring tests can be set by defining an `interval` property within each profile. We currently allow 2 scheduled tests per day, so the minimum value for `interval` is `12`.

You can choose to cancel these at any time by removing the `interval` property from the profile.

**Please note:** This feature is still under development. If your scheduled tests stop firing, you might need to request one manually so that it triggers the scheduled ones again.

<h2 id="alerts">Alerts</h2>

If you define [performance budgets](#budgets), you can choose to receive alerts when any of the metrics goes above its budget. Currently, notifications can be delivered via e-mail or Slack messages.

An alert is defined as an object inside `alerts` in the main config, where the key is an identifier of the alert. Different alert types have different configuration parameters.

| Parameter | Specific to alert | Description |  Encrypted |
|-----------------|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `type` | â€” | Type of the alert (e.g. `email`) |  No |
| `recipients` | `email` | List of e-mail addresses to receive the alert fo | Yes |
| `hookUrl` | `slack` | Slack webhook URL | Yes |
| `channel` | `slack` | Slack channel | No |
| `username` | `slack` | Username for the Slack bot | No |
| `iconEmoji` | `slack` | Emoji to be used as icon by the Slack bot | No |

For example, the following block would define two alerts, one of type e-mail and another one of type Slack. The following should go in the main config file (`speedtracker.yml`).

```yml
alerts:
  mainAlert:
    type: 'email'
    recipients: ['1q2w3e4r']
  slackAlert:
    type: 'slack'
    hookUrl: 'p0o9o8i7u6y5t4r3e2w1q'
    channel: '#speedtracker'
    username: 'SpeedTracker'
    iconEmoji: ':grimacing:'
```

<h2 id="budgets">Budgets</h2>

Performance budgets are defined per-profile, within the profile configuration file, and can monitor any metric used by SpeedTracker. A budget is defined with the following parameters.

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `metric` | Id of the metric to monitor | `firstPaint` |
| `min` | Defines a minimum value for the metric | `900` |
| `max` | Defines a maximum value for the metric | `90000` |
| `alerts` | List of alerts to trigger when the budget is overrun. These are the alert identifiers you define on [alerts](#alerts) | `eduardoboucas.com (3G)` |

The following block, extracted from `_profiles/default.html`, shows how to define a budget of 5s for `fullyLoaded`, which will trigger `mainAlert` and `slackAlert`, as well as a budget of 3s for `firstPaint`, triggering `slackAlert` only.

```yml
budgets:
  -
    metric: fullyLoaded
    max: 5000
    alerts: ['mainAlert', 'slackAlert']
  -
    metric: firstPaint
    max: 3000
    alerts: ['slackAlert']
```

<h1 id="run">Run a test</h1>

With everything configured, we can finally request a test. You can use the UI on [https://speedtracker.org/test](https://speedtracker.org/test), or alternatively fire a `GET` or `POST` request to the following URL, replacing the placeholders with your GitHub username or organisation, the name of the repository, the branch, the id of the profile and the encryption key, respectively.

```
https://api.speedtracker.org/v1/test/{USERNAME}/{REPOSITORY}/{BRANCH}/{PROFILE}?key={KEY}
```

You can use this URL to request tests programatically. For example, you can use it as a post-commit webhook on GitHub, so that your website is tested every time you make a deployment.

Please note that your test will be added to a queue, so it may take some time for the new result to be shown on your visualisation layer.
